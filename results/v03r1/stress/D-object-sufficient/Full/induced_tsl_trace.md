# LATIS v0.3R.1 induced TSL trace

Only training IO enters Learn; test labels are evaluated after selection. StructuralPriorCount=0.

The root is a typed Scene -> Scene graph. Return-type filtering visits the entire Base registry. Effect checks restrict conditional witness input domains. Each witness produces child learning tasks; a rule is activated only after every child has a nonempty version space. No task classifier selects scan.

Limits: depth=7, extraction frontier=32; 64 witness decompositions/rule; 96 observer terms/type with 2 semantic alternatives. Forward observers are bounded Base subexpressions, not complete programs. The version space is the discovered bounded support, not all possible Base programs.

Abstraction is typed anti-unification plus explicit lambda lifting. MDL compares a nonoverlapping portfolio cover including definition and argument costs. Accepted definitions feed later Learn through checked Base expansion, with matching tests counted. Online rounds and all dictionary/AST/parameter bounds are finite. `I<n>` has no preassigned semantic label.

Legacy hierarchical codecs are retained in solve-v03 and measured separately. This solver constructs its grounded observations from Base expressions; richer local/global codec discovery remains a coverage limitation.
